1. <FIXED>
issues displaying lists as a string nicely, can't seem to get the .join function working

strange bug:                             ^
PS C:\Users\err0rz\portfolio-err0rzzz\peasant_quest> python main.py
  File "main.py", line 206
    if playercommand not in command_list:
                                        ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax


playercommand = input ()
playercommand = playercommand.lower()
command_list = ['look','go north','go south','go west','go east']

if playercommand not in command_list:
    print ('the peasant does not know that command, the commands he knows are: ' + str(command_list))
