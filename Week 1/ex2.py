#### Mathematics Example ####
print ("How Many Sides on each type of number and type dice?")
print ("2xD10", 2 * 10)
print ("5xD20", 5 * 20)
### testing greater than / less than##
print ("is it greater?", 5 > -2 ) #greater than
print ("greater than or equal", 5 >=- 2) #greater than or equal
print ("Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2) #less than or equal
### checking if brackets and operators can be used to change maths order ###
print (5 + 3 * 5 - 1) ##control
print ((5 + 3) * 5 - 1) ##it works
